<h1>Covid19_Analysis_and_Visualization.ipynb</h1>

This work presents the **analysis and visualization** to measure the spread of COVID-19 region-wise. Coronavirus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused major worldwide problems. As the number of coronavirus cases reportedly increases, the spread of COVID-19 turns out to be a serious threat to global health.

Data Pre-Processing steps include:

1. Reading the data from Github repository containing daily total cases of confirmed, death and recovered cases per location as provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).
2. Fixing region name and concatenating country and province name to one column “region”. Then, clearing wrong characters within the dataset.

The dataset named "Data_for_UCI_named" is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have performed **data pre-processing & modeling** on the dataset and used three classifiers for classification purpose, named:

1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Logistic Regression Classifier
3. XGBoost Classifier

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score have been also calculated.

<h1>Python_classes_Numpy_arrays_Pandas_manipulation.ipynb & Data_manipulation_and_visualization.ipynb</h1>
These two notebooks deal with the use of Python to implement the concepts of:

1. Classes
2. Numpy arrays
3. Pandas manipulation
4. Scatter plot and bar chart

Dataset used is **Data_for_UCI_named**.
