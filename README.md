The dataset named "Data_for_UCI_named" is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have performed data pre-processing on the dataset and performed classification using three classifiers, named:

1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Logistic Regression Classifier
3. XGBoost Classifier

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score have been also calculated.

** Covid19_Analysis_and_Visualization.ipynb **

This work presents the analysis and visualization to measure the spread of COVID19 per given region. Coronavirus(COVID19 or SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused major worldwide concern. As the number of coronavirus cases reportedly increases, the spread of COVID19 is a serious threat to global health.

Data Pre-Processing steps include:

1. Reading the data from Github repository containing daily total cases of confirmed, death and recovered cases per location as provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).
2. Fixing region name and concatenating country and province name to one column “region”. Then, clearing wrong characters within the dataset.
